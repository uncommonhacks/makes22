            Uncommon Hacks is known for organizing 24-hour programming competitions (hackathons) for the UChicago community. This fall, we're doing things differently: instead of judging projects based on their functionality, we will be looking at ~design~.
            <p class="subinfo">HOW DOES IT WORK?</p>
            Once you arrive at noon, we'll announce the theme for this year's Makes, and then quickly jump into two workshops that introduce you to two technologies that could help you make your project:
            <ul>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              If you're looking to approach it more design-heavy, we will have a workshop for Figma, which is a very powerful tool for creating designs.
              </li>
              <li>
              If you're looking to approach it more code-heavy, and have some background with web development, we will teach you React, which is a framework that simplifies the process of developing dynamic websites.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="subinfo">JUDGING</p>
            After lunch and two hours of work, you will submit your prototypes/websites to us for judging, as well as present your work to other participants. And then we'll award prizes (TBD)!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            An important thing to note here is that since Makes is a designathon, we won't be judging based on functionality, but rather on how cool/user-friendly your website would be if it were fully developed. So you're free to do stuff like tell us "hey, this part is not done yet but here is what I was thinking!"</span>
